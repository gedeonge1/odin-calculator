# odin-calculator

In  this odin project I have made a simple calculator that takes 2 values at a time and returns answer. 
It has functionalities like
-passing decimal numbers 
-switching form Grey to Dark mode and vice versa

At the moment there is no backspace  button on this calculator, however it has clear all button.
